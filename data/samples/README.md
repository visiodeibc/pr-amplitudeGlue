- `ecommerce.json`: Purchase, abandonment, and return flows with loyalty traits, nested experiments, and media attachments for returns. Highlights mixed numeric, boolean, and array attributes.
- `streaming.json`: Playback telemetry, buffering incidents, and personalization impressions including multi-device context, experiments, and ad inventory details.
- `finance.json`: Loan disbursement lifecycle with risk alerts and reconciliation events, covering nested ownership hierarchies, ledger splits, and fraud signals.
